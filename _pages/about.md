I'm currently a PhD candidate at [MReaL Lab](https://mreallab.github.io), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) advised by [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/). I am gratefully supported by [AISG PhD fellowship](https://aisingapore.org/research/phd-fellowship-programme/). Prior to the PhD, I received B.E. and M.E. degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in 2016 and 2019.

I focus on learning unbiased models against the distribution shifts in computer vision, vision-language, long-tailed classification, etc.
